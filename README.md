### Task

Please see below a link to a book about Object Oriented Programming in Java: [http://www.dblab.ntua.gr/~gtsat/collection/Java%20books/Bruce.Eckel.Thinking.In.Java.4th.Edition.Dec.2007.eBook-BBL.pdf](http://www.dblab.ntua.gr/~gtsat/collection/Java%20books/Bruce.Eckel.Thinking.In.Java.4th.Edition.Dec.2007.eBook-BBL.pdf)

Also, try the following:

- Set up a simple relational database locally e.g. MYSQL, Postgres, etc. When you install the database, figure out how to store all the data required for an online store. Think about how you would be able store the Customers, Products, Orders, Order Items etc. When you do this, add test data to the database and try to figure out how you will run queries like:
    - Get all the orders over the last X months
    - Get all the products that are instock
    - Get all the products that are out of stock
    - Get all the customers that have more than 1 order
    - Get all the customers who have purchased product X
    - Get all the total spend of a given customer
    - Get the total sales of product X
- Build a simple **web application** using python or Java that will read the data from the database and make the data available using REST API Endpoints. Do the following:
    - Write code functionality that will allow CRUD operations to the database, how to retrieve, add, delete, and update a Customer/Products/Orders
    - Write API endpoints in Java or Python that will expose the CRUD functionality via HTTP GET, DELETE, or POST requests
    - While writing the code, think about Object Oriented Design and try to design the code efficiently. Apply some of the techniques you learn from the OOP book I shared above.
    - Write some unit tests. How would you mock a database?
- Try to see if you can host the code using an online cloud platform like heroku, there are free options.
- Try to share your code on github
- Try to break down the work in small, well-defined tasks. Use a tool to keep track of your tasks and backlog, e.g. Trello or Jira.
